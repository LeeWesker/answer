1. Protocol layer attack - HTTP request smuggling 


2. XSS attack: Cross-Site Scripting. 

Filter special characters
One of the ways to avoid XSS is to filter the content provided by the user (such as the script tag above).

Specify the type using HTTP headers
w.Header().Set("Content-Type","text/javascript")
This allows the browser to parse the javascript code instead of html output


3. CSRF（Cross-site request forgery）

Synchronizer Tokens: Hide a randomly changing csrf_token in the form. The csrf_token is submitted to the background for verification. If the verification passes, the operation can continue.

Hash encrypted cookie csrf_token


4. Forge X-Forwarded-For

Configure on the Nginx reverse proxy server directly facing the outside world:
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
In the business code, use the getClientIp() method above to obtain the leftmost IP address of X-Forwarded-For, which is the real address.
